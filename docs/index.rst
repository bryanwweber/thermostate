Welcome to ThermoState's documentation!
=======================================

ThermoState is a Python package that provides easy management of thermodynamic states of simple
compressible systems. ThermoState relies on `CoolProp <http://www.coolprop.org/>`__ and
`Pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`__ to provide the equations of state and units handling,
respectively. ThermoState replaces tables that are typically used in engineering courses to
evaluate properties when solving for the behavior of systems.
