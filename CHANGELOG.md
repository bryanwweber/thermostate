### Added
- Plots!
- Python 3.10 support
- Default units can now be specified for `State` instances

### Changed
- Python >= 3.9 requires CoolProp from their source repository

## [1.2.1] - 21-JUL-2020
### Changed
- Allow Pint up to 1.0, they seem to be pretty stable between minor version releases

### Fixed
- Typo in pythonpackage.yml

## [1.2.0] - 14-JUL-2020
### Added
- Build CoolProp from the master branch to avoid any regressions
- Cache the built CoolProp wheel, based on the CoolProp master commit hash

### Changed

- The default branch is now called `main`.

### Fixed
- Bump the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for GitHub Actions, seems like they moved to 10.14
- Bump Pint version in the Conda recipe
- Add Matplotlib as a dependency in the Conda recipe

## [1.1.0] - 12-APR-2020
### Added
- Build CoolProp and run the tests on Python 3.8
- Set up the Matplotlib functionality built into Pint. This bumps the minimum Pint version to 0.9 and adds Matplotlib as a dependency

### Changed
- Updated documentation links in README and conda recipe to ReadTheDocs

### Fixed
- The Rankine cycle example had a dimensionality error due to better NumPy support in Pint. Fixes #24.

- Apply Black formatter to tests
- Use tox to test against multiple Python versions
- Use GitHub Actions for CI services
- Run Black formatter on `abbreviations.py` and `_version.py`
- License year in `LICENSE.md`. Happy New Year :tada:

### Fixed
- README.md and CHANGELOG.md are now included in the sdist
- `hx` and `xh` are added to the disallowed property pairs because they raise `ValueError`s in CoolProp
- Missing docstrings from some functions in `thermostate.py`

## [0.5.3] - 04-MAR-2019
### Added
- Check if temperature, pressure, and specific volume are positive (in absolute units)

### Fixed
- Broken link in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to `LICENSE.md`
- Installation instructions for CoolProp updated for Python 3.7
- Equality checking for `State`s now considers the substance [[#17](https://github.com/bryanwweber/thermostate/pull/17)]. Resolves [#16](https://github.com/bryanwweber/thermostate/issues/16) (Thanks [@egurra](https://github.com/egurra)!)
